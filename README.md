# Ecole

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ds4dm/ecole.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ds4dm/ecole)

Ecole (pronounced [ek…îl]) stands for _Extensible Combinatorial Optimization Learning
Environments_ and aims to expose a number of control problems arising in combinatorial
optimization solvers as Markov
Decision Processes (_i.e._, Reinforcement Learning environments).
Rather than trying to predict solutions to combinatorial optimization problems directly, the
philosophy behind Ecole is to work
in cooperation with a state-of-the-art Mixed Integer Linear Programming solver
that acts as a controllable algorithm.

The underlying solver used is [SCIP](https://scip.zib.de/), and the user facing API is
meant to mimic the [OpenAi Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) API (as much as possible).

## User Documentation
Please refer to the (upcoming) documentation for tutorials, examples, and installation
instructions.

## Developer Notes
### Build dependencies
#### Conda
  All dependencies required for building can be resolved using a
  [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment.
  Install everything in a development (named `ecole`) environment using
  ```bash
  conda env create -n ecole -f conda-dev.yml
  ```
  For the following, the `ecole` environment always needs to be activated
  ```bash
  conda activate ecole
  ```
  *Note: this environment contains tools to build ecole and scip, format code, test,
  generate documentation etc. These are more than the dependencies to only use Ecole.*

#### CMake
  [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a meta-build tool, configuring other build tools
  (_e.g._ Make) or IDE's.
  The whole build of Ecole can be done with CMake.
  A one-time configuration is necessary for CMake to find dependencies, detect system
  information, _etc_.
  This is the time to pass optional build options, such as the build type and compiler
  choice. For instance `-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug` can be added to compile with debug
  information.
  Using `cmake`, we recommend building out of source using `cmake -B build/` to
  configure, and `cmake --build build/` to compile.
  CMake is made available in the `ecole` environment created earlier.

### Runtime dependencies
  * **SCIP** - Head to the [download page](https://scip.zib.de/index.php#download),
    select a version greater than 6.0 and download the `scipoptsuite-x.y.z.tgz` file
    (where `x.y.z` is to be replaced with the selected version).
    Extract it using
    ```bash
    tar -xz -f scipoptsuite-x.y.z.tgz
    ```
    In the extracted folder, configure and build with CMake
    ```bash
    cmake -B build/ -D PARASCIP=1 -D GMP=0 -D ZIMPL=0 -D GCG=0 -D READLINE=0
    cmake --build build/ --parallel
    ```
    Finally, install SCIP in the `ecole` conda environment
    ```bash
    cmake --install build/ --prefix $(conda run -n ecole echo '$CONDA_PREFIX')
    ```

### Building
  Building Ecole is very similar to building SCIP, as they both use CMake.
  In the Ecole source repository, configure using
  ```bash
  cmake -B build -D ECOLE_DEVELOPPER=ON
  ```
  The definition `-D ECOLE_DEVELOPPER` changes the defaults settings (such as the build
  type, static analysis, _etc._) for added convenience and ensuring high quality
  contributions.
  Only the default settings are changed.
  This mode does not override any explicitly setting.

  Then, build Ecole with
  ```bash
  cmake --build build/
  ```
  The Python package can be installed from the build directory
  ```bash
  python -m pip install -I build/python
  ```

### Running the tests
#### C++ tests
  The C++ tests are build with [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
  It produces a single standalone executable under `build/libecole/tests/test-libecole`.
  For test options, consult
  ```bash
  build/libecole/tests/test-libecole --help
  ```

#### Python tests
  Python tests are build with [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
  As any Python project, running the tests require that Python finds the correct Ecole
  package.
  It is therefore **not recommended** to manually install Ecole between every tests, as
  it leaves room for running tests with an out of date installation.
  The CMake configuration creates a Python virtual environment and install the Ecole
  Python package inside automatically.
  To run the tests (or another operation with Python Ecole), use the virtual
  environemnt
  ```bash
  ./build/venv/bin/python -m pytest python/tests/
  ```

### Generating the documentation
  The documentation is a CMake target that is not build by default.
  When using `-D ECOLE DEVELOPPER=ON`, the documentation can be generated by providing
  the target to the CMake build command:
  ```bash
  cmake --build build --target ecole-sphinx
  ```
  The HTML files generated are located under `build/doc/sphinx/html`.
  In particular, `build/doc/sphinx/html/index.html` can be opened in your browser to
  visualize the documentation.

### Coding standards
  The quality and conventions of the code are enforced automatically with various tools
  detailed here.

#### C++ toolset
  Visual layout of the code is formated using
  [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).
  All files can be formatted at once using
  ```bash
  find libecole python -name '*.[hc]pp' -exec clang-format --style=file -i {} \;
  ```

  Additional coding best practices are enforced through
  [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/).
  `clang-tidy` is run automatically in CMake when using `-D ECOLE_DEVELOPPER=ON` to
  ensure that the guidelines are respected.
  The tool also has the ability to fix (some) errors automatically, but this is not done
  in CMake (which does not modify the source code).
  To run, the tool needs access to a _compilation database_.
  The database is also created automatically when using `-D ECOLE_DEVELOPPER=ON`, but the
  file need to be accessible at the root directory of the project.
  One can create a symbolic link (assuming the build dircetory is named `build`) using
  ```bash
  ln -s build/compile_commands.json
  ```
  Then, `clang-tidy` can be run on all files for fixing with
  ```bash
  find libecole python -name '*.[hc]pp' -exec clang-tidy --fix --fix-errors {} \;
  ```

  Both these tools are available in the conda environment.
  They also integrate seamlessly with most editors and IDE to avoid running these
  commands manually.

#### Python toolset
  Python code is formatted using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io).
  `black` is available in the conda environment, and all files can be formatted using
  ```bash
  python -m black python/
  ```
