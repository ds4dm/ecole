Ecole (pronounced [ek…îl]) stands for *Extensible Combinatorial Optimization Learning
Environments* and aims to expose a number of control problems arising in combinatorial
optimization solvers as Markov
Decision Processes (*i.e.*, Reinforcement Learning environments).
Rather than trying to predict solutions to combinatorial optimization problems directly, the
philosophy behind Ecole is to work
in cooperation with a state-of-the-art Mixed Integer Linear Programming solver
that acts as a controllable algorithm.

The underlying solver used is `SCIP <https://scip.zib.de/>`_, and the user facing API is
meant to mimic the `OpenAi Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_ API (as much as possible).

.. code-block:: python

   import ecole

   env = ecole.environment.Branching(
       reward_function=-1.5 * ecole.reward.LpIterations() ** 2,
       observation_function=ecole.observation.NodeBipartite(),
   )
   instances = ecole.instance.SetCoverGenerator()

   for _ in range(10):
       obs, action_set, reward_offset, done, info = env.reset(next(instances))
       while not done:
          obs, action_set, reward, done, info = env.step(action_set[0])
