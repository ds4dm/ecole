        Parameters
        ----------
        instance:

            episode.

            evaluation for the sum of rewards when one needs to account for computations that

            presolving...).

        instantiation or since a terminal state.

        Parameters
        ----------
        action:
            The action to take in as part of the Markov Decision Process.
            If an action set has been given in the latest call (inluding calls to
